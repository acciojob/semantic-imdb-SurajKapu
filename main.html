		<p>
		  In 2006, Rocky Balboa, now 60 years old is retired from boxing, lives a quiet life as a widower, his wife Adrian having died from cancer four years prior. He now runs a small but successful Italian restaurant named after her, where he regales patrons with tales from his past. 
	
		Rocky sets straight to training with Apollo Creed's (and later his) old trainer, Duke, who quickly surmises that Rocky can only compete by building his strength and punching power as much as possible. On the day of the match, Dixon easily dominates the first round, only to injure his left hand on Rocky's hip in the second. Rocky then makes a dramatic comeback, knocking Mason down, and surprising the audience with his prowess and chin despite his age. The two combatants beat each other severely throughout the full 10 rounds, ending with both men still standing, although Rocky gets the last punch.

		“Nobody is gonna hit as hard as life, but it ain’t how hard you can hit. It’s how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. It’s how much you can take, and keep moving forward. That’s how winning is done.”
